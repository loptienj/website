<h1>Remote access and logging in</h1>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is available over the campus
  network and the general Internet largely by way of the Secure Shell,
  or ssh, protocol. Access is provided via one of the dedicated login
  nodes.</p>

<p>When you have logged into an RC login node, you are accessing one
  of several virtual machines intended to present a development
  environment, facilitate the submission of jobs to other resources,
  and enable interactive access to storage resources. Use of the login
  nodes should be restricted to editing, small-scale (non-MPI)
  compilation and job submission. Running CPU- or memory-intensive
  processes on the logni nodes is actively discoutaged. Data analysis
  and large-scale data transfers should be done via scheduled
  jobs. <a href="software-compilation.html">Software compilation</a>
  is best done on the targeted resource via
  an <a href="batch-queueing.html#interactive_jobs">interactive
    job</a> or (for applications that are meant to run on Janus) on one
  of the <a href="software-compilation.html#janus_compile_nodes">Janus
    compile nodes</a>.</p>

<h2>The secure shell (ssh)</h2>

<p>Once you have</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtained a Research Computing account;</li>
  <li>obtained an OTP authenticator;</li>
  <li>and registered and tested your OTP authenticator</li>
</ul>

<p>you should be able to log into an RC login node using the secure
  shell (ssh).</p>

<p>The <code>ssh</code> command can be run from the Linux and OS X
  command-line. For Windows clients we recommend
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
  application.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l $rc_username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>the first time you log in, the system will configure your internal
  ssh key pair, used for authentication between internal hosts.</p>

<pre><code>Attempting to create internal ssh config for connecting to
CURC managed resources...  Generating public/private rsa key pair.

<h3>Further reading</h3>

<p>The ssh protocol and its related applications have many
  features. It can be used as simply as described here, to provide
  simple shell access to the RC login nodes; but it can also</p>

<ul>
  <li>transfer files,</li>
  <li>forward X11 GUI application interfaces,</li>
  <li>proxy TCP connections,</li>
  <li>multiplex sessions through a single connection,</li>
</ul>

<p>and much more.</p>
