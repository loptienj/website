<h2>Geting an account</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is available to CU-Boulder,
  CU-Denver, and NCAR users. If you are a CU user, request access
  using
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">RC
  Account Request portal</a>. If you are an NCAR user, request access
  through
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/janus/allocations">CISL
  allocation request system</a>.</p>

<p>External users must obtain
  a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/identikey-accounts/sponsored">sponsored
  affiliate account</a> with CU before they will be able to request a
  Research Computing account.</p>

<h2>NCAR accounts</h2>

<p>NCAR users can access RC resources using their NCAR account. Use
  your NCAR Yubikey or CryptoCard to authenticate.</p>

<p>More information is available on
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu">Computational &amp;
  Information Systems Lab</a> website.</p>

<h2>Account deletion</h2>

<p>User accounts on specific resources are subject to deletion based
  on a review of resource balance or allocation time (i.e. a project
  has ended or an account exists during a review cycle that isnâ€™t
  associated with any active projects).  Users will have one month
  warning to reapply for a project or to retrieve files, data, and
  application codes.  After the one month period, the data associated
  with the account on the specific resource will be deleted and no
  backups will be preserved.</p>

<h2 id="otp">One-time passwords (OTP)</h2>

<p>One-Time Passwords (OTP) provide better security for online account
  access than traditional memorized or stored passwords. The password
  generated in the OTP login process is only valid for one session. A
  string of six digits, generated approximately every 30 seconds, is
  displayed to the customer on a hardware authenticator device. To log
  in, the user enters their username and generates a password by
  combining a secret four digit PIN with the six digit string
  displayed on the authenticator, resulting in a 10-digit numeric
  password.</p>

<p>The standard authenticator (password generator) used by CU-Boulder
  is
  the <a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/single_button_digipass/digipass_go6.aspx">VASCO
    GO-6</a>. Other authenticators are available including
  <a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/software_digipass/digipass_for_mobile.aspx">smartphone
    application based authenticators</a> and audio authenticators for
  the visually impaired.</p>
