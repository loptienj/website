<h1>File and data transfer</h1>

<p>Research Computing offers two primary mechanisms for data transfer:
  SSH-based scp and sftp; and GridFTP, including access from Globus
  Connect.</p>

<h2>SSH file transfer (SCP / SFTP)</h2>

<p>SSH-based file transfer is not particularly efficient or performant
  (especially compared to the Globus and GridFTP method detailed
  below) but, because it uses the same software that is already used
  for interaction with Research Computing resources, it is still
  commonly used.</p>

<h3>Command-line secure copy (SCP)</h3>

<p>Files can be transferred to and from the Research Computing
  environment using
  the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/scp"><code>scp</code></a>
  command from a Unix or Linux command-line (including Mac OS X).</p>

<pre><code>$ scp ${local_filename} ${rc_username}@login.rc.colorado.edu:</code></pre>

<div class="tutorial">Tutorial: When transferring files
  using <code>scp</code>, it is particularly useful to use OpenSSH
  ControlMaster
  to <a href="../examples-and-tutorials/reduced-otp-password-entries.html">reduce
  OTP password entries</a>.</div>

<h3>Interactive clients</h3>

<p>Files can also be trasferred to and from the Research Computing
  environment using a number of interactive file transfer
  applications. The most basic of these
  is <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/sftp"><code>sftp</code></a>,
  available from a Unix or Linux command-line (including Mac OS
  X).</p>

<pre><code>$ sftp ${rc_username}@login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>Once an SFTP connection is established, files can be transferred
  using the <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> commands. More
  information can be accessed using the <code>help</code> command.</p>

<p>Alternative (and graphical) file transfer clients are available for
  Windows, including</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a>, a
    multi-protocol, multi-platform file-transfer application.</li>

  <li><a href="http://winscp.net">WinSCP</a>, a basic SCP/SFTP
    file-transfer application for Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>Graphical file-transfer applications often retain passwords for
  automatic authentication for later transfers. Because Research
  Computing uses one-time passwords for
  authentication, <strong><em>you must disable password retention /
  saving in your file-transfer client</em></strong>. Failure to do so
  may cause your account to be temporarily disabled after the client
  attempts and fails to authenticate repeatedly in the background.</p>

<h3>File-system and application integration</h3>

<p>SSH-accessible filesystems can be directly integrated into
  compatible applications and Operating Systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html">SSHFS, a
      FUSE-based filesystem implementation used to mount remote
      SSH-accessible filesystems, is available for
      Linux, <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io">OS X</a>, and even
      <a href="https://code.google.com/p/win-sshfs/">Windows</a>.</li>
  <li>Emacs <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode"><code>tramp-mode</code></a>
    can be configured to access files on remote systems over SSH.</li>
</ul>

<p>Configuration of these OS and application-level integrations is
  currently outside the scope of this guide.</p>

<h2>Globus and GridFTP</h2>

<p>Globus addresses deficiencies in secure copy requests by automating
  large data transfers, by resuming failed transfers, and by
  simplifying the implementation of high-performance transfers between
  computing centers.</p>

<h3>Globus.org and Globus Connect</h3>

<p>Globus Connect is a Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of the
  Globus Toolkit which provides end-users with a browser interface to
  initiate data transfers between endpoints registered with the Globus
  Alliance. Globus Connect allows registered users to “drag and drop”
  files from one endpoint to another. Endpoints are terminals for
  data; they can be laptops or supercomputers, and anything in
  between. The servers at Globus.org act as
  intermediaries-negotiating, monitoring and optimizing transfers
  through firewalls and across network address translation
  (NAT). Under certain circumstances with high performance hardware
  transfer rates exceeding 1Gb/s are possible. Due to its ease of use,
  Globus Connect is recommended for individuals without extensive IT
  experience.</p>

<p>We recommend reading through Open Science Grid's
  excellent <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GlobusOnlineTutorial">Globus
  Online tutorial</a>.  Note that the “Activating an Endpoint” section
  does not pertain to Research Computing’s configuration.</p>

<h4>Getting an account</h4>

<p>To use Globus Connect, you will first need to sign up for an
  account at <a href="https://www.globus.org/">Globus.org</a>. Once
  you have a Globus.org account, you can (optionally) associate your
  CU IdentiKey with your account: from the
  <a href="https://www.globus.org/SignIn">SignIn</a> page, follow the
  "alternate login" link and select "InCommon" from the
  available choices.</p>

<h4>Transferring data to/from a local workstation</h4>

<p>You can use Globus Connect to transfer data between your local
  workstation (e.g., your laptop or desktop) and Research
  Computing. In this workflow, you configure your local workstation as
  a Globus endpoint using Globus Connect.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Globus.org</li>

  <li>Use
     the <a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/ManageEndpoints/">Manage
     Endpoints</a> interface to “add Globus Connect Personal” as an
     endpoint.
     (<a href="https://support.globus.org/entries/23879396">More
     information at Globus.org support.</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/StartTransfer">Transfer
      Files</a>, using your new workstation endpoint for one side of
      the transfer, the Research Computing endpoint
      (<code>colorado#gridftp</code>) for the other side. (You will be
      required to authenticate to the Research Computing endpoint
      using your RC account and OTP.)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Trasferring data between two remote endpoints</h4>

<p>Globus.org can also be used to transfer data between two remote
  Globus endpoints (e.g., between your local compute center's Globus
  endpoint and the Research Computing endpoint.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Globus.org</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/StartTransfer">Transfer
      Files</a>, using the Research Computing endpoint
      (<code>colorado#gridftp</code>) for one side of the transfer,
      and another endpoint of your choice for the other side. (You
      will be required to authenticate to the Research Computing
      endpoint using your RC account and OTP. The other endpoint may
      require its own authentication as well.)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Globus Connect command-line interface</h4>

<p>Globus.org provides a command-line interface (CLI) as an
  alternative to its web interface. This command-line interface is
  provided over an SSH connection to a Globus.org server.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use
    the <a href="https://www.globus.org/account/ManageIdentities">Manage
    Identities</a> interface at Globus.org to upload your ssh public
    key.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Connect to Globus.org using an ssh client.</p>

    <pre><code>$ ssh -l ${globus_username} cli.globusonline.org</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>The Globus.org command-line interface can start and manage
    transfers, manage files on an endpoint, and configure endpoints
    associated with your account. Use the <code>help</code> command
    for more information on the commands available, or visit
    the <a href="https://support.globus.org/entries/30058643/">Globus.org
    support system</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>GridFTP</h3>

<p>The Research Computing Globus endpoint
  (<code>colorado#gridftp</code>) is served by four physical
  servers. Globus automatically automizes transfers using these
  four servers.</p>

<p>GridFTP provides much of the underlying framework for Globus
  Connect and is part of the Globus Toolkit, but it can be used
  independently of Globus.org and Globus Connect, particularly if your
  site already has a Globus and GridFTP infrastructure in place.</p>

<p>Benchmarks indicate indicate that a fully-tuned manual GridFTP
  transfer
  (using <a href="http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/5.2/5.2.4/appendices/commands/#globus-url-copy"><code>globus-url-copy</code></a>)
  is only marginally faster than the same transfer using
  Globus.org. Both are significantly faster than SSH-based file
  transfer (e.g., <code>scp</code>, <code>sftp</code>).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bootstrap trust in the Research Computing MyProxy CA server
      (<code>gridftp-00.rc.colorado.edu</code>).</p>

    <pre><code>$ export MYPROXY_SERVER_DN="${MYPROXY_SERVER_DN}/C=US/O=Globus Consortium/OU=Globus Connect Service/CN=e40cb9bc-033a-11e1-bc86-12313804ec2a"
$ myproxy-logon --trustroots --bootstrap --pshost gridftp-00.rc.colorado.edu --username ${cu_username}</code></pre>

    <p>This exports a non-standard certificate Distinguished Name to
      your environment and downloads certificates to bootstrap trust
      in our CA server.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Initiate a transfer using <code>globus-url-copy</code>,
      specifying a Research Computing GridFTP server DN with
      the <code>-source-subject</code> (<code>-ss</code>)
      argument.</p>

    <pre><code>$ globus-url-copy -ss "/C=US/O=Globus Consortium/OU=Globus Connect Service/CN=e40cb9bc-033a-11e1-bc86-12313804ec2a" gsiftp://gridftp-00.rc.colorado.edu:2811/${remote_path} file:///${local_path}</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The above is only a minimal example, and would only open a
  connection to a single Research Computing GridFTP server
  (<code>gridftp-00</code>. To learn more about using GridFTP, read
  the <a href="http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/6.0/gridftp/user/#gridftpUser">GridFTP
  User's Guide</a>.</p>
