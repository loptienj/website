<p>This user guide assumes familiarity with the following topics:</p>

<h2>Cluster computing and high performance computing</h2>

<p>Understand the basics of what these types of resources are and what
  they can and cannot do. Understand how high-performance computing
  environments differ from a desktop computing environment. (It's not
  just a faster desktop!)</p>

<h2>Unix/Linux</h2>

<p>Research Computing resources are presented in a Linux
  environment. Be comfortable working from a command-line (notably the
  "bash" shell). Understand how to edit text files, and manipulate
  file and directory permissions.</p>

<h2>Shell scripting</h2>

<p>Compute jobs launched on Research Computing compute resources are
  initialized by user-written shell scripts. Beyond that, many common
  operations can be simplified and automated using shell scripts.</p>
