<h1>Linux and the command line</h1>

<h2>The default shell</h2>

<p>The user's shell (the program that accepts and executes commands)
  is selected during the account request process. Most users are using
  the default
  shell, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">"Bash."</a></p>

<p>When you log in you may see a basic shell prompt: <code>-bash-2.11 $</code></p>

<p>You can customize the prompt by setting the <code>PS1</code>
  environment variable. Documentation for setting <code>PS1</code> is
  available in
  the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash"><code>bash</code>
  manpage</a>, and many examples are available online.</p>

<pre><code>$ PS1="[\u@\h \W]\\$ "</code></pre>

<p>When a user logs in interactively and starts a Bash shell, a number
  of scripts are executed automatically. Users typically edit these
  scripts in their home directory to set up their environment upon
  login. In the RC environment, edit the .my.xxx version of these
  files.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>.my.bash_profile</code></dt>
  <dd>executed for login shells</dd>

  <dt><code>.my.bashrc</code></dt>
  <dd>executed for non-login shells (and not re-executed if you invoke
    a second shell)</dd>

  <dt><code>.my.logout</code></dt>
  <dd>executed at logout</dd>
</dl>

<p>In some cases, it may be appropriate to record all configuration
  in <code>.my.bashrc</code> and "source" <code>.my.bashrc</code>
  from <code>.my.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<pre><code>source ~/.my.bashrc</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to load modules from your <code>.my.bashrc</code> or
  <code>.my.bash_profile</code>, but this can have unintended
  consequences. In the Research Computing environment it is very
  important to be aware that your jobs will run in a different
  environment from the interactive login session. Your job scripts
  must be written to load relevant modules as needed, regardless of
  whether they are loaded at job submission.</p>
