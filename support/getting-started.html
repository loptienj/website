<p>In order to use Research Computing resources, you'll need to get an
  RC account. You may also need to get a resource allocation, or learn
  how to access the resources you want to use.</p>

<p>This getting-started guide will help guide you through these first
  few steps toward using RC resources, based on your particular
  needs. More information is available in
  the <a href="user-guide.html">User Guide</a>, and links to more
  documentation will be provided throughout this process.</p>

<p>If, at any time, you are unsure how to proceed, please contact us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>. Your
  feedback will help us make this getting-started guide, and the rest
  of our documentation, better!</p>

<h2 id="account">Get an account</h2>

<p>Again, the first thing that every prospective Research Computing
  user must do is get
  an <a href="user-guide/accounts.html">account</a>. This process is
  dependent on your current affiliation.</p>

<p>If you already have an RC account, skip ahead
  to "<a href="#resources">Get access to resources</a>." Otherwise,
  select from the following list:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="getting-started/cu-boulder-user.html">I am affiliated
      with CU-Boulder or already have a CU-Boulder account.</a></dt>
  <dd>If you already have a CU-Boulder or account, you can directly
    request an RC account and one-time-password (OTP) token.</dd>

  <dt><a href="getting-started/cu-denver-user.html">I am affiliated
      with CU-Denver.</a></dt>
  <dd>If you are affiliated with CU-Denver, you can request an RC
    account and one-time-password (OTP) token.</dd>

  <dt><a href="getting-started/ncar-user.html">I am affiliated with
      NCAR, and already have an NCAR account.</a></dt>
  <dd>You can use your NCAR account to authenticate to RC resources,
    but you will need to work with CISL to gain access.</dd>

  <dt><a href="getting-started/sponsored-user.html">I an affiliated
      with another institution and am collaborating with a CU-Boulder
      researcher.</a></dt>
  <dd>You can access CU and RC resources through the CU sponsored
    affiliate program.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All users of Research Computing resources are responsible for
  complying with all university policies, including (but not limited
  to) those defined at
  <a href="http://oit.colorado.edu/policies/cu-boulder-it-policies">http://oit.colorado.edu/policies/cu-boulder-it-policies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Get access to resources</h2>

<p>Once you have an <a href="user-guide/accounts.html">RC account</a>,
  you can request access to RC resources, or access resources that you
  are already authorized to use.</p>

<p>All RC users have access to
  the <a href="user-guide/remote-access.html">RC login
  environment</a>, so you're welcome to start there. If you want to do
  any actual computation, or store any significant quantity of data,
  you'll need to get access to one of the more specialized Research
  Computing resources.</p>
