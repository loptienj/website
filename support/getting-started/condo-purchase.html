<p>Research Computing maintains
  a <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#blanca">Condo
  Computing service</a> that offers researchers the opportunity to
  purchase and own compute nodes that will be operated as part of a
  cluster, named “Blanca.” The aggregate cluster is made available to
  all condo partners while maintaining priority for the owner of each
  node.</p>

<h2>Purchase nodes in the Research Computing condo</h2>

<p>Contact us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a> if
  you are interested in purchasing nodes in the Research Computing
  condo cluster "Blanca." Visit
  our <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#blanca">user
  guide</a> for details on available node configurations, including a
  general-purpose compute node, a GPU-enabled node, and a high-memory
  node.</p>

<p>Once your nodes have been purcahsed and installed by Research
  Computing staff, you will be provided with a list of hostnames, as
  well as the name of a dedicated Slurm QOS that you can use to submit
  compute jobs to your nodes.</p>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p><a href="../user-guide/remote-access.html">Access to Research
  Computing resources</a> is primarily provided using the secure shell
  (SSH) protocol. The <code>ssh</code> command can be run from the
  Linux and OS X command-line. For Windows clients we recommend
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
  application, though alternatives exist.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l $rc_username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>When you're prompted for a password, <em>do not enter a CU
    IdentiKey password</em>. Most users should have already obtained
    an OTP authenticator device, in which case your RC "password" is
    the combination of your PIN and the one-time password generated by
  your OTP token.</p>

<pre><code>password: &lt;pin&gt;&lt;one-time password&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you are an NCAR user, authenticate using your NCAR Yubikey or
  CryptoCard.</p>

<h2>Submit jobs to the queue</h2>

<p>Research Computing uses
  a <a href="../user-guide/batch-queueing.html">queueing system</a>
  called <a href="http://slurm.schedmd.com">Slurm</a> to manage
  compute jobs on compute resources, including Blanca. In general,
  you'll submit compute jobs (in the form of job scripts) to the
  system using the <code>sbatch</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo >test-job.sh '#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name test-job
#SBATCH --time 05:00
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --output test-job.out

echo "The job has begun."
echo "Wait one minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a second minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a third minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Enough waiting: job completed."'

$ module load slurm/blanca
$ sbatch test-job.sh</code></pre>

<p>You can monitor the progress of your job in the queue using
  the <code>squeue</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ squeue --user $USER</code></pre>

<p>Once your job has completed (denoted by the <code>CG</code> state)
  you can find the output in the <code>test-job.out</code> file, as
  defined in the <code>test-job.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test-job.out</code></pre>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

  submit jobs to the queueing system, you may want to read a bit more
