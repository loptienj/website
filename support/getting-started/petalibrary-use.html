<p>The PetaLibrary is a National Science Foundation-subsidized service
  for the storage, archival, and sharing of research data, housed in
  the Space Sciences data center at CU-Boulder. It provides both
  active (disk) and archive (disk+tape HSM) storage for a modest fee
  to any US-based researcher affiliated with the University of
  Colorado Boulder, and supports Globus / GridFTP for convenient
  high-performance data transfer into and out of the PetaLibrary.</p>

<h2>Complete the End User Agreement, request access</h2>

<p>Access to
  the <a href="../user-guide/storage.html#petalibrary">PetaLibrary</a>
  is moderated by an End User Agreement, included as APPENDIX A in
  the <a href="https://www.rc.colorado.edu/sites/default/files/PetalibraryMOU.pdf">PetaLibrary
  Memorandum of Understanding</a>. Complete this form and the Order
  Form (APPENDIX B), and send them both
  to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Have the PetaLibrary allocation owner
  contact <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>
  to grant you access.</p>

<h2>Get a globus account</h2>

<p>Sign up for an account
  at <a href="https://www.globus.org/">Globus.org</a>, the recommended
  high-performance mechanism for transferring data in and out of the
  PetaLibraty. Once you have a Globus.org account, you can
  (optionally) associate your CU IdentiKey with your account: from the
  <a href="https://www.globus.org/SignIn">SignIn</a> page, follow the
  "alternate login" link and select "InCommon" from the
  available choices.</p>

<h2>Install Globus Connect</h2>

<p>Download and
  install <a href="https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal">Globus
  Connect Personal</a>, which serves as a Globus endpoint on your
  local workstation. (Globus Connect is available for Mac Os X, Linux,
  and Windows.)</p>

<p>With Globus Connect running, you can transfer data between your
  local workstation (e.g., your laptop or desktop) and The PetaLibrary
  using the globus.org web interface.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Globus.org</li>

  <li>Use
     the <a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/ManageEndpoints/">Manage
     Endpoints</a> interface to “add Globus Connect Personal” as an
     endpoint.
     (<a href="https://support.globus.org/entries/23879396">More
     information at Globus.org support.</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/StartTransfer">Transfer
      Files</a>, using your new workstation endpoint for one side of
      the transfer, the Research Computing endpoint
      (<code>colorado#gridftp</code>) for the other side. (You will be
      required to authenticate to the Research Computing endpoint
      using your RC account and OTP.)</li>
