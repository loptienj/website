<p>Research computing maintains a shared computing infrastrucure for
  the RC user community, including
  the <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#janus">Janus HPC
    cluster</a>,
  <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#crestone">Crestone
    bladecenter</a>, <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#gpu">GP-GPU
    nodes</a>,
    and <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#himem">large-memory
    nodes</a>. Accessing these resources involves getting access to a
    compute allocation, logging in using SSH, and submitting jobs to
    the queueing system.</p>

<h2>Request access to a compute allocation</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing computational resources is moderated
  by finite <a href="../user-guide/allocations.html">allocations</a>
  of compute time. If you are working with a PI who already has an
  active allocation, have them email us at
  <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a> to
  request that you be added to it.</p>

<p>If you are just getting started with Research Computing, and need
  some time to explore the capabilities of the system, you
  can <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/allocation/request/startup/">request
  a ‘startup’ allocation</a>, available to each new user.</p>

<p>If you're already comfortable with high-performance computing, and
  know that you will need more compute time than is given with a
  startup allocation, you can proceed directly to a
  full <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/allocation/request/project/">
  allocation request</a>.</p>

<p>In any of these cases, after any necessary review and approvals,
  you will receive an allocation ID that is associated with a
  consumable allocation of compute time, measured
  in <abbr title="service units">SU</abbr> or core-hours. You can use
  this allocation ID when submitting compute jobs to the queueing
  system.</p>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p><a href="../user-guide/remote-access.html">Access to Research
  Computing resources</a> is primarily provided using the secure shell
  (SSH) protocol. The <code>ssh</code> command can be run from the
  Linux and OS X command-line. For Windows clients we recommend
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
  application, though alternatives exist.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l $rc_username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>When you're prompted for a password, <em>do not enter a CU
    IdentiKey password</em>. Most users should have already obtained
    an OTP authenticator device, in which case your RC "password" is
    the combination of your PIN and the one-time password generated by
  your OTP token.</p>

<pre><code>password: &lt;pin&gt;&lt;one-time password&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you are an NCAR user, authenticate using your NCAR Yubikey or
  CryptoCard.</p>

<h2>Submit jobs to the queue</h2>

<p>Research Computing uses
  a <a href="../user-guide/batch-queueing.html">queueing system</a>
  called <a href="http://slurm.schedmd.com">Slurm</a> to manage
  compute resources and to schedule jobs that use them. In general,
  you'll submit compute jobs (in the form of job scripts) to the
  system using the <code>sbatch</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo >test-job.sh '#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name test-job
#SBATCH --time 05:00
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --output test-job.out

echo "The job has begun."
echo "Wait one minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a second minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a third minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Enough waiting: job completed."'

$ module load slurm
$ sbatch --qos janus-debug test-job.sh</code></pre>

<p>You can monitor the progress of your job in the queue using
  the <code>squeue</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ squeue --user $USER</code></pre>

<p>Once your job has completed (denoted by the <code>CG</code> state)
  you can find the output in the <code>test-job.out</code> file, as
  defined in the <code>test-job.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test-job.out</code></pre>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Now that you can log into the Research Computing environment and
  submit jobs to the queueing system, you may want to read a bit more
