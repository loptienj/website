<h2>Request an allocation</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing computational resources is moderated
  by finite allocations of compute time. If you are working with a PI
  who already has an active allocation, have them email us at
  <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a> to
  request that you be added to it. Otherwise, use
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/allocation/request/">Allocation
    Request page</a> to request a ‘startup’ allocation, available to
  each new user. Otherwise click below to request your own
  allocation.</p>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is primarily provided using
  the secure shell (SSH) protocol. The ssh command is available on
  virtually any Linux or Mac OS X system. If you are a Windows user,
  we recommend that you use
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
  ssh client application, though alternatives exist.</p>
