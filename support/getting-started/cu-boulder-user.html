<p>Users with an existing CU-Boulder account can request a Research
  Computing account using
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">RC
  Account Request portal</a>, and will authenticate to the RC
  environment using
  a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/one-time-password-authentication/help/order-authenticator">Digipass
  one-time password authenticator.</a></p>

<h2>Complete the account request form</h2>

<p>Visit
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">RC
  Account Request portal</a> to complete the account reqeust
  form. Select "University of Colorado - Boulder" as your affiliation,
  and authenticate using your CU IdentiKey credentials (i.e., your
  username and password) to complete your account request. After
  review, your account will be created by a member of the Research
  Computing staff, and login details will be provided to you by
  email.</p>

<h2>Get and register an authenticator</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources
  requires <a href="../user-guide/accounts.html#otp">two-factor
  authentication</a>. Request your physical one-time-password (OTP)
  generator device by either</p>

<ul>
  <li>filling out
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/one-time-password-authentication/help/order-authenticator">OIT
      Authenticator order form</a>, or</li>
  <li>emailing your request
    to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be prepared to show your BuffOne card or other state-issued ID when
  you pick up your authenticator.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve received your OTP authenticator, register it at
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu">OTP Self Service portal</a>,
  and verify that it works by following the instructions on
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu/index.php?view=testlogin">OTP
    Login Test page</a>.</p>
