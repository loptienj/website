<p>The PetaLibrary is a National Science Foundation-subsidized service
  for the storage, archival, and sharing of research data, housed in
  the Space Sciences data center at CU-Boulder. It provides both
  active (disk) and archive (disk+tape HSM) storage for a modest fee
  to any US-based researcher affiliated with the University of
  Colorado Boulder, and supports Globus / GridFTP for convenient
  high-performance data transfer into and out of the PetaLibrary.</p>

<h2>Complete the End User Agreement and Order Form</h2>

<p>Complete
  the <a href="../user-guide/storage.html#petalibrary">PetaLibrary</a>
  End User Agreement, part of
  the <a href="https://www.rc.colorado.edu/sites/default/files/PetalibraryMOU.pdf">PetaLibrary
  Memorandum of Understanding</a>. Also complete the included order
  form, and send both
  to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Once your order has been processed, your storage will be made
  available as part of the greater Research Computing filesystem
  hierarchy, and the path to your allocated storage will be provided
  to you. This path will be accessible from most Research Computing
  resources,
  including <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#janus">Janus</a>
  and the <a href="../user-guide/remote-access.html">login
  nodes</a>.</p>

<h2>Get a globus account</h2>

<p>Sign up for an account
  at <a href="https://www.globus.org/">Globus.org</a>, the recommended
  high-performance mechanism for transferring data in and out of the
  PetaLibraty. Once you have a Globus.org account, you can
  (optionally) associate your CU IdentiKey with your account: from the
  <a href="https://www.globus.org/SignIn">SignIn</a> page, follow the
  "alternate login" link and select "InCommon" from the
  available choices.</p>

<h2>Install Globus Connect</h2>

<p>Download and
  install <a href="https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal">Globus
  Connect Personal</a>, which serves as a Globus endpoint on your
  local workstation. (Globus Connect is available for Mac Os X, Linux,
  and Windows.)</p>

<p>With Globus Connect running, you can transfer data between your
  local workstation (e.g., your laptop or desktop) and The PetaLibrary
  using the globus.org web interface.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to Globus.org</li>

  <li>Use
     the <a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/ManageEndpoints/">Manage
     Endpoints</a> interface to “add Globus Connect Personal” as an
     endpoint.
     (<a href="https://support.globus.org/entries/23879396">More
     information at Globus.org support.</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.globus.org/xfer/StartTransfer">Transfer
      Files</a>, using your new workstation endpoint for one side of
      the transfer, the Research Computing endpoint
      (<code>colorado#gridftp</code>) for the other side. (You will be
      required to authenticate to the Research Computing endpoint
      using your RC account and OTP.)</li>
</ol>
