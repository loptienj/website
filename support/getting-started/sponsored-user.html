<p>People collaborating with CU-Boulder researchers may access RC
  resources, but must first obtain a CU-Boulder sponsored affiliate
  account. After that point, the process of getting an RC account is
  the same as for an internal CU-Boulder user.</p>

<h2>Get a CU-Boulder sponsored affiliate account</h2>

<p>The CU-Boulder faculty or staff member that you are collaborating
  with must apply for your sponsored account as your account
  sponsor. The application process is detailed on
  the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/identikey-accounts/sponsored">CU
  OIT website</a>; but is as simple as sending the required
  information
  to <a href="mailto:help@colorado.edu">help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>

<p>When your account request has been processed and approved, you will
  receive login details for your account, including your new CU
  username and IdentiKey password. You will use these credentials when
  applying for your RC account.</p>

<h2>Complete the RC account request form</h2>

<p>Visit
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">RC
  Account Request portal</a> to complete the account reqeust
  form. Select "University of Colorado - Boulder" as your affiliation,
  and provide your CU IdentiKey credentials (i.e., your username and
  password) to complete the rest of the form. After review, your
  account will be created by a member of the Research Computing staff,
  and login details will be provided to you by email.</p>

<h2>Get and register an authenticator</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources
  requires <a href="../user-guide/accounts.html#otp">two-factor
  authentication</a>. Request your physical one-time-password (OTP)
  generator device by either</p>

<ul>
  <li>filling out
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/one-time-password-authentication/help/order-authenticator">OIT
      Authenticator order form</a>, or</li>
  <li>emailing your request
    to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be prepared to show a state-issued ID when you pick up your
  authenticator.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve received your OTP authenticator, register it at
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu">OTP Self Service portal</a>,
  and verify that it works by following the instructions on
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu/index.php?view=testlogin">OTP
    Login Test page</a>.</p>
