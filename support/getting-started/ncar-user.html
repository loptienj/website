<p>Affiliates of <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu"><abbr title="National Center for Atmospheric Research">NCAR</abbr></a> have access to
  the <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#janus">Janus</a>
  compute cluster through
  <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu"><abbr title="Computational and Information Systems Lab">CISL</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Apply for an allocation</h2>

<p>CU-Boulder Research Computing accounts for NCAR users are created
  as part of the CISL allocation process. Submit a request for an
  allocation on the Janus cluster using
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/janus/allocations">CISL
  allocation request process</a>. Once your request is approved, you
  will receive login details, including your RC username.</p>

<p>When you log into RC systems, authenticate to your RC account using
  your NCAR Yubikey or CryptoCard. (More information on logging into
  RC systems is available in the user guide, and later in the getting
  started guide.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Once you have received your Janus allocation and RC account,
continue <a href="shared-compute.html">getting started with the shared
    computing infrastructure</a>.</p>
