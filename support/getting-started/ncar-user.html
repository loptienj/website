<p>Affiliates of <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu"><abbr title="National Center for Atmospheric Research">NCAR</abbr></a> have access to
  the <a href="../user-guide/compute-resources.html#janus">Janus</a>
  compute cluster through
  <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu"><abbr title="Computational and Information Systems Lab">CISL</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Apply for an allocation</h2>

<p>Submit a request for an allocation on the Janus cluster using
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/janus/allocations">CISL
  allocation request process</a>. Once your request is approved, you
  will receive login details, including your RC username.</p>

<p>When you log into RC systems, authenticate to your RC account using
  your NCAR Yubikey or CryptoCard. (More information on logging into
  RC systems is available in
  the <a href="../user-guide/remote-access.html">user guide</a>,
  and later in the getting started guide.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Now that you have an RC account, you're ready
  to <a href="../getting-started.html#resources">get started with the
  specific RC resources that you're interested in using</a>. You
  should also read the
  CISL <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/janus/ncarusers">"Quick
  start for NCAR users."</a></p>
