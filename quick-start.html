<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>This is a quick-start guide to getting up and running in the
  Research Computing environment. This guide describes how to request
  an account, the process to obtain an authenticator device needed to
  log in, how to log into the RC environment and some important
  details about the storage and modular software environment.</p>

<p>Users of Research Computing resources are responsible for complying
  with all university policies, including (but not limited to) those
  defined at
  <a href="http://oit.colorado.edu/policies/cu-boulder-it-policies">http://oit.colorado.edu/policies/cu-boulder-it-policies</a>.</p>

<h2>Get an account</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is available to CU-Boulder,
  CU-Denver, and NCAR users. If you are a CU user, request access
  using
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">RC
  Account Request portal</a>. If you are an NCAR user, request access
  through
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/janus/allocations">CISL
  allocation request system</a>.</p>

<p>External users must obtain
  a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/identikey-accounts/sponsored">sponsored
  affiliate account</a> with CU before they will be able to request a
  Research Computing account.</p>

<h2>Get and register an authenticator</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources requires two-factor
  authentication. If you are an NCAR user, use your Yubikey or
  Cryptocard to authenticate. If you are a CU user, request a physical
  one-time-password (OTP) generator device by either
  <ul>
    <li>filling out
      the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/one-time-password-authentication/help/order-authenticator">OIT
        Authenticator order form</a>, or</li>
    <li>emailing your request to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Be prepared to show your BuffOne card or other state-issued ID when
  you pick up your authenticator.</p>

<p>Once you’ve received your OTP authenticator, register it at
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu">OTP Self Service portal</a>,
  and verify that it works by following the instructions on
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu/index.php?view=testlogin">OTP
    Login Test page</a>.</p>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is primarily provided using
  the secure shell (SSH) protocol. The ssh command is available on
  virtually any Linux or Mac OS X system. If you are a Windows user, we
  recommend that you use
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY<a>
      ssh client application, though alternatives exist.</p>

<h2>Request an allocation</h2>

<p>Access to Research Computing computational resources is moderated
  by finite allocations of compute time. If you are working with a PI
  who already has an active allocation, have them email us at
  <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a> to
  request that you be added to it. Otherwise, use
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu//login/?next=/allocation/request/">Allocation
    Request page</a> to request a ‘startup’ allocation, available to each
  new user. Otherwise click below to request your own allocation.</p>
