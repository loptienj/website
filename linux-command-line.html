<h1>Linux and the command line</h1>

<h2>The default shell</h2>

<p>The user's shell (the program that accepts and executes commands)
is selected during the account request process. Most users are using
the default shell, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">"bash."</a></p>

<p>When you log in you may see a basic shell prompt: <code>-bash-2.11 $</code></p>

<p>You can customize the prompt by setting the <code>PS1</code>
environment variable. Some examples are listed here; but you can find
more examples online, or construct your own by consulting the bash
manpage.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Black username, Blue host, Green working directory</dt>
  <dd><code>PS1="[\[\e[0;30m\]\u\[\e[0;31m\]@\[\e[0;34m\]\h \[\e[0;32m\]\W]\$\[\e[0m\] "</code></dd>
  <dt>A simple blue prompt with the time of day, user@host, working directory:</dt>
  <dd><code>PS1="\[\033[1;34m\][\$(date +%H:%M)][\u@\h:\w]$\[\033[0m\] "</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>When a user logs in interactively and starts a Bash shell, a number
of scripts are executed automatically. Users typically edit these
scripts in their home directory to set up their environment upon
login. In the RC environment, edit the .my.xxx version of these files,
which is done for portability.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>.my.bash_profile</code></dt>
  <dd>this is executed for login shells</dd>
  <dt><code>.my.bashrc</code></dt>
  <dd>executed for non-login shells (thus not re-executed if you invoke a second shell)</dd>
  <dt><code>.my.logout</code></dt>
  <dd>executed at logout</dd>
</dl>

<p>In some cases, it may be appropriate to record all configuration
in <code>.my.bashrc</code> and "source" <code>.my.bashrc</code>
from <code>.my.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<p>It is possible to add modules to your .my.bashrc or
.my.bash_profile, but this can be dangerous. In the RC environment it
is very important to be aware that your jobs will run in a different
environment from the one you set up for your interactive login
shell. Your job scripts must be written to load relevant modules as
needed.</p>

<p>If you would like to change your shell, please send us an email
at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>, and
tell us your username and shell of choice.</a></p>
