<p>Because <a href="../remote-access.html">one-time passwords</a>
  (like those generated by the Research Computing Vasco tokens) are,
  by design, only valid once, they cannot be cached for automatic
  entry by an ssh client. The Research Computing environment does not
  permit SSH keys for remote access, either; so users often find
  themselves having to frequently type in an OTP password.</p>

<p>OpenSSH (a common SSH client present on most Linux and Unix
  systems, including Mac OS X) provides a feature that allows multiple
  SSH sessions to share a single connection. The practical result is
  that a user need log in only once, with all other connections being
  directed over the existing, pre-authenticated connection.</p>

<p><em>This configuration takes place on your local client /
    workstation, not on a Research Computing login node or other
    system. Run these commands on your local system.</em></p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh
$ echo >>~/.ssh/config 'Host *login*.rc.colorado.edu
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%u_%h_%p_%r'</code></pre>

<p>With this stanza in place at the bottom of
  your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file, you can ssh
  to <code>login.rc.colorado.edu</code> (or any specific Research
  Computing login node) and every subsequent connection will share the
  first connection. You will not be required to re-authenticate unless
  all open connections are closed.</p>

<p>There are many more customization opportunities available in
  the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file (notably the remote username and
  keepalive settings). For more information, see
  the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh%5fconfig&amp;sec=5"><code>ssh_config(5)</code><a/>
  manpage.</p>

<pre><code>$ man 5 ssh_config</code></pre>
