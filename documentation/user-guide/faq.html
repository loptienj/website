<p>If you have a question that is not answered in the user guide, or
  need general help with a Research Computing system, please contact
  us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>. Some
  of our most frequently asked questions are presented here, with
  references to the user guide where more information can be
  found.</p>

<h2>Remote access and logging in</h2>

<h3>How do I get an account?</h3>

<p>Accounts for CU-Boulder and UC-Denver affiliates can be requested
  via
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/account/request/">account
  request portal</a>.  NCAR affiliates must apply for accounts
  through <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu">CISL</a>.</p>

<p>External users must first obtain
  a <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/identikey-accounts/sponsored">sponsored
  affiliate account</a> with CU.</p>

<h3>How do I register a one-time password (OTP) authenticator?</h3>

<p>Register your authenticator
  at <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu">otp.colorado.edu</a>. The
  process is documented in the <a href="remote-access.html#otp">user
  guide</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I log into my account?</h3>

<p>Computational access to Research Computing systems is primarily
  provided <a href="remote-access.html">via ssh</a>. Access to storage
  resources is primarily provided via <a href="file-transfer.html">SSH
  and Globus</a>.</[>

<h2>Allocations</h2>

<h3>How do I get an allocation?</h3>

<p>All new accounts are eligible for a start-up allocation upon
  request. Additional allocations are granted upon request with
  sufficient justification. More information is available in
  the <a href="allocations.html">user guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Batch queueing and job scheduling</h2>

<h3>What queues are available?</h3>

<p>Research Computing uses Slurm, which uses a single job queue. In
  stead of queues, Slurm uses resource partitions and
  quality-of-service (QOS) values to set limits and priorities and to
  assign jobs to resources.</p>

<p>More information on selecting a QOS value for your job is available
  in the <a href="batch-queueing.html#qos">user guide</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I run multiple serial jobs in parallel?</h3>

<p>Research Computing provides a
  simple <a href="../examples-and-tutorials/load-balancer.html">load-balancer</a>
  that can run multiple serial processes as tasks in a larger
  job.</p>

<h3>When will my job start running?</h3>

<p>Slurm can provide an estimate of when your jobs will start, along
  with what resources it expects to dispatch your jobs to.</p>

<pre><code>$ squeue --user=$USER --start</code></pre>

<p>Start times vary, and are largely dependent on the existing job
  load. A small debug job should start within a few minutes. A
  production 96-core job might take a few hours to start. A large,
  long job may spend several days or a week in the queue before
  starting.</p>

<p>More information is available in
  the <a href="batch-queueing.html#monitoring">user guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<h3>How long are backups saved in the PetaLibrary?</h3>

<p>The PetaLibrary does not offer a contentional backup service.
  Storage options with "replication" or "second copy on tape" are
  designed to protect against a media failure, not accidental
  deletion. Changes to files on primary storage propagate
  automatically to the replicated copy, and if a file is deleted from
  the main storage it should not be expected to remain on the copy.</p>

<h3>Can I mount my PetaLibrary project directory to my desktop computer?</h3>

<p>We do not currently support NFS or CIFS exports from the
  PetaLibrary to the campus network, but similar (unsupported) access
  could be provided
  using <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html">sshfs</a>.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to access a file in the PetaLibrary Archive?</h3>

<p>Files that have been migrated to tape can takes up to a minute to
  load the appropriate tape cartridge, plus another minute or two to
  advance the tape to the spot where the file is located. Data is then
  read from the tape at up to 160 MB/s. If all tape drives are in use
  by other file operations, processes, then the data recall will wait
  until a tape drive becomes available.</p>

<h3>What tools and processes are available on the PetaLibrary for data and metadata management, curation, and information lifecycle management?</h3>

<p>The PetaLibrary is designed primarily as a storage facility,
  leaving management of the stored data to the project
  owner. However, <a href="https://data.colorado.edu/">CU Research
  Data Services</a> can offer assistance with many aspects of the data
  management process.</p>

<h3>Can I back up my PC to the PetaLibrary?</h3>

<p>The PetaLibrary has been funded to store research data, not for
  general-purpose storage or
  backups. The <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/file-transfer-storage-infrastructure/ucb-files-storage">UCB
  Files</a> storage service is an alternative for general file
  storage.</p>

<h3>Why shouldnâ€™t I use rsync to synchronize my local data with
  PetaLibrary Archive?</h3>

<p>rsync synchronizes data by comparing file content in addition to
  file metadata. In an HSM environment like PetaLibrary Archive, these
  content comparisons require that all files be recalled from tape to
  disk, making rsync an inefficient mechanism for synchronizing
  files.</p>

<h3>Why are my PetaLibrary transfers slow?</h3>

<p>The PetaLibrary has a 10 Gb/s connection to the CU Science Network,
  allowing transfers at speeds up to 800 MB/s; but slower networks in
  your department or institution are likely to be the greatest
  limiting factor when moving data in and out of the PetaLibrary. If
  you have confirmed with your local network administration that you
  have a 10 Gb/s or faster connection between yourself and the
  PetaLibrary, contact us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>
  for help troubleshooting the connection.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<h3>Will you install software for me?</h3>

<p>We prefer that software is installed first by a user that will use
  it. For more information is available in
  the <a href="software.html">user guide</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I profile my code?</h3>

<p>We recommend using
  the <a href="http://hpctoolkit.org">HPCToolkit<a/>.</p>

<h3>How do I access LAPACK and BLAS?</h3>

<p>We recommend using Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), especially if
  you are compiling with the Intel Compiler Suite.</p>

<pre><code>$ module load intel/intel-13.0.0</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer an open source implementation, we provide the GNU
  Scientific Library.</p>

<pre><code>$ module load gsl/gsl-1.15_gcc-4.7.2</code></pre>
