<p>This is a simple example illustrating how to use the
<a href="https://github.com/ResearchComputing/lb">load balancer</a>
tool.  Essentially you enumerate the commands you would like to
execute in parallel in a file, making sure that you only put one
command per line. If you have multiple commands as part of the same
task, separate them with a semicolon (;). This means that you can
use your favorite scripting language to create your set of tasks,
or you can simply copy-and-paste if you only have a few.
</p>

<p>There are two ways to execute this code: interactively and batched.
More information about submitting jobs in the Research Computing
environment is available in the documentation for
<a href="../batch-queueing.html">batch queueing and job scheduling</a>.

<ol>
<li>
Create the <code>cmd_lines</code> file in the directory you created.
<pre><code>
$ for  i in {1..100} ; do
>   echo "sleep 2; echo hostname $i" >> cmd_lines
> done
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
Load the load balancer module.
<pre><code>
$ module load loadbalance
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
Submit your job, for example using srun.
<pre><code>
$ srun lb cmd_lines
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
