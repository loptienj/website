<p>The OpenSSH client has a number of configuration
  options. Specifying these options in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>
  file can simplify the process of accessign remote servers that you
  use frequently.</p>

<p>Configuration options in <code>~/.ssh.config</code> can be thought
  of as being grouped into logical stanzas with a <code>Host</code>
  pattern as its header. (This is not quite true; but it's a usable
  enough model for most cases.)</p>

<h2><code>HostName</code></h2>

<p>The first thing you might want to do is specify host aliases for a
  server that you access fequently. You might have been doing this
  already with a shell script, shell alias, or some other mechanism;
  but it's easy to do it with OpenSSH itself, and it has the benefit
  of initializing your configuration stanza, as well.</p>

<pre><code>Host login curc rc login.rc.colorado.edu
HostName login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>With this simple stanza defined in <code>~/.ssh.config</code>, you
  can now ssh into a Research Computing login node
  (<code>login.rc.colorado.edu</code>) with any of the defined
  aliases.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh login
$ ssh curc
$ ssh rc
$ ssh login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<h2><code>User</code></h2>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have the same username on all the local
  and remote systems you use, then this feature won't mean much to
  you; but if you're like most people, you have one username on your
  office workstation, a different username on your home workstation,
  and quite possibly a different username at each remote system you
  access.</p>

<p>Rather than having to remember and specify your username each time
  you log into a remote system (with <code>-l</code>
  or <code>$user@$host</code>), you can record the correct username
  for each remote host in <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, and the defined
  username will be used by default when accessing that
  host. (Otherwise, OpenSSH will attempt to use your client-side
  username by default.)</p>

<pre><code>Host login curc rc login.rc.colorado.edu
HostName login.rc.colorado.edu
User joan5896</code></pre>

<h2><code>ForwardX11</code></h2>

<p>Do you frequently use X11 forwarding to run graphical utilities on
  a Research Computing login node? If so, you probably usually
  specify <code>-X</code> or <code>-Y</code> when logging in. You can,
  however, configure OpenSSH to forward X11 connections
  automatically.</p>

<pre><code>Host login curc rc login.rc.colorado.edu
HostName login.rc.colorado.edu
User joan5896
ForwardX11 yes</code></pre>

<h2>More options</h2>

<p>Virtually any option that can be specified during an ssh login can
  be added to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. For a full list of the
  available options, see
  the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh%5fconfig&amp;sec=5"><code>ssh_config(5)</code><a/>
  manpage.</p>

<pre><code>$ man 5 ssh_config</code></pre>

<p>Of particular additional note are the <code>ControlMaster</code>
  and <code>ControlPath</code> options, which can be used to reduce
  the burden of using a one-time password (OTP) authenticator; but
  these options are covered in
  a <a href="reduced-otp-password-entries.html">separate
  tutorial</a>.</p>
