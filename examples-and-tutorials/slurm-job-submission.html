<p>This tutorial demonstrates the process of submitting a compute job
  to the Research Computing batch queueing system, Slurm. The example
  job should run long enough to allow you to see it running and see
  the output file get created and updated.</p>

<p>Note: The example job does nothing but waste computer time. Please
  resist the temptation to run it at a larger scale.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you need

  <ul>
    <li>an RC account</li>
    <li>a registered OTP authenticator</li>
    <li>an SSH client application</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>First, log into an RC login node. This step is dependent on your
  local environment; but in an OS X or Linux environment, you should
  be able to use the standard OpenSSH command-line client.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -l $username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<h2>Prepare a job directory</h2>

<p>In your home directory (which is the directory you will be using by
  default when you first log in) create a subdirectory to contain your
  test job script and your job's eventual output.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir test-job
$ cd test-job</code></pre>

<p>The <code>cd</code> changes your working directory to the
  new <code>test-job</code> directory, which you can confirm with
  the <abbr title="print working directory"><code>pwd</code></abbr>
  command.</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/home/ralphie/test-job</code></pre>

<h2>Write the job script</h2>

<p>In a batch queueing environment like that at Research Computing,
  compute tasks are submitted as scripts that will be executed by the
  queueing system on your behalf. This script often contains embedded
  metadata about the resources required to complete the job (e.g., the
  number of compute nodes and cores and for how long you intend to use
  them).</p>

<p>You can write this script in any text editor. For ease of
  instruction here, use
  the <abbr title="concatenate"><code>cat</code></abbr> command to
  redirect the script text into a file.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat - >test-job.sh &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name test-job
#SBATCH --time 05:00
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --output test-job.out

echo "The job has begun."
echo "Wait one minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a second minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Wait a third minute..."
sleep 60
echo "Enough waiting: job completed."
EOF</code></pre>

<p>This script describes a job named "test-job" that will run for no
  longer than five minutes. The job consists of a single task running
  on a single node, with output directed to
  a <code>test-job.out</code> file.</p>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="concatenate"><code>cat</code></abbr>
  command again to confirm the content of the
  new <code>test-job.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test-job.sh</code></pre>

<h2>Submit the job</h2>

<p>The <code>test-job.sh</code> file is a Bash shell script that
  serves as the initial executable for the
  job. The <code>#SBATCH</code> directives at the top of the script
  inform the scheduler of the job's requirements.</p>

<p>To submit the script as a batch job, first load
  the <code>slurm</code> module, which will provide access to the Slurm
  commands.</p>

<pre><code>$ module load slurm</code></pre>

<p>Use the <code>sbatch</code> command to submit the script to
  Slurm.</p>

<pre><code>$ sbatch --qos janus-debug test-job.sh
Submitted batch job 56</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--qos</code> argument causes the job to be treated as a
  "debug" job which will grant it additional priority at the cost of
  tighter restrictions on its size and length. (<code>--qos</code>
  could have also been included in an <code>#SBATCH</code> directive
  in the script itself.)</p>

<p>When Slurm accepts a new job, it responds with the job id (a
  number) that can be used to identify the specific job in the
  queue. Referencing this job id when
  contacting <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>
  can expedite support.</p>

<h2>Monitor job execution</h2>

<p>Use the <code>squeue</code> command to monitor the status of
  pending or running jobs.</p>

<pre><code>$ squeue --user $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
                56     janus test-job  ralphie  R       0:06      1 node1701</code></pre>

<p>If your job has not already started (i.e., it has a state
  of <code>PD</code> in stead of <code>R</code>) you can use
  the <code>--start</code> flag to query the estimated start time for
  your job.</p>

<pre><code>$ squeue --user $USER --start</code></pre>

<p>Once the job has started, the output it generates will be directed
  to the <code>test-job.out</code> file referenced in the job
  script. You can watch the output as it is written using
  the <code>tail</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -F test-job.out</code></pre>

<p>Once the script has finished, the state will transition
  to <abbr title="completed"><code>C</code></abbr>, and the job will
  eventually exit the queue.</p>
