<h2>Account deletion</h2>

<p>User accounts on specific resources are subject to deletion based
  on a review of resource balance or allocation time (i.e. a project
  has ended or an account exists during a review cycle that isnâ€™t
  associated with any active projects).  Users will have one month
  warning to reapply for a project or to retrieve files, data, and
  application codes.  After the one month period, the data associated
  with the account on the specific resource will be deleted and no
  backups will be preserved.</p>
