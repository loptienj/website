<p>Access to Research Computing compute resources is moderated using
  finite time-based allocations. Each jobs run in the Research
  Computing queueing system is assocaited with and charged to an
  allocation. If the job's allocation is not sufficient for the
  estimated requirements of the job, the job will not start and
  additional time must be allocated. (Jobs prevented from running due
  to an exhausted allocation will be identified with the pending
  reason "<code>AssociationJobLimit</code>.")</p>

<p>The Research Computing allocation polities and procedures are
  intended to ensure that the Janus facility and other RC resources
  are fairly shared, effectively used, and support CU-Boulderâ€™s
  research programs.</p>

<p>Compute allocations are expressed in <abbr title="service unit">SU</abbr>,
  with 1 SU equivalent to 1 core-hour on any allocated
  RC resource. Allocations are granted for 3-12 months, after which they expire.</p>

<p>Use of any Research Computing allocation is subject to the following conditions:
  <ol>
    <li>Use of the Janus supercomputer must be acknowledged in
      publications using the following text:

      <p>This work utilized the Janus supercomputer, which is
        supported by the National Science Foundation (award number
        CNS-0821794), the University of Colorado Boulder, the
        University of Colorado Denver, and the National Center for
        Atmospheric Research. The Janus supercomputer is operated by
        the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Use of the Janus supercomputer is subject to export control regulations. The PI must cerfity that
      <ol>
        <li>The system will be used for fundamental research intended
          to be published without any restrictions.</li>
        <li>The PI will ensure that all users added under their
          allocation to the system are (a) employees, students, or
          visitors of a U.S. university, or (b) citizens or permanent
          residents of the United States.</li>
        <li>The PI will retain records or correspondence documenting
          the export control status of every user requested.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The PI agrees to provide summaries of activities and
      accomplishments resulting from use of the Janus system to
      facilitate the annual reporting requirements to the NSF and the
      VCR office.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>Getting a new allocation</h2>

<p>All users are allowed a single "startup" or "testing" allocation of
  50,000 SU. This amount of time is generally enough for a lot of
  testing and can be used to develop a proof of concept for a larger
  allocation request. Use the research
  computing <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/allocation/request/">allocation
  request form</a> to request a startup allocation. Startup
  allocations cannot be transferred or shared.</p>

<p>Larger "project" allocations require supporting documentation which
  may be submitted by the project's principal investigator (PI) or an
  authorized collaborator. In either case, the PI must have a Research
  Computing account in order to be associated with the allocation.</p>

<p>Any CU-Boulder researcher, educator, or postdoctoral fellow may
  request an allocation as a PI for the purpose of research or
  education. After the allocation has been granted, the project PI may
  request access for other users, including students and collaborators
  both local and external. (The project PI is responsible for ensuring
  that work done by remote collaborators is directly related to the
  allocated project.</p>

<p>When filling out
  the <a href="https://portals.rc.colorado.edu/allocation/request/project/">allocation
  request form</a>, be sure to include a proposal that describes

  <ul>
    <li>the purpose and significance of the project</li>

    <li>numerical techniques or third-party software that will be
      used</li>

    <li>the characteristics of your results and how they will be
      analyzed and prsented</li>

    <li>previous work that informs the request, especially any
      previous use of Research Computing resources</li>

    <li>any previous publications resulting from the project,
      especially those that used Research Computing resources</li>

    <li>how the size of the request was determined</li>

    <li>alternative implementations that might require more or less
      resources</li>

    <li>how your code will use parallel resources, including
      multi-core CPUs, multi-node jobs, and parallel I/O</li>

    <li>any work already done to optimize relevant code and workflow
      (e.g., compiler optimizations, workflow optimizations to more
      fully utilize nodes)</li>

    <li>the expected characteristics (CPU, memory, disk) and quantity
      of your compute jobs, and what sort of monthly load we should
      expect (i.e., Will the compute time be used roughly equally
      each month, or 6 months of heavy usage and then a small amount
      of post-processing work?)</li>

    <li>funds that support the project, including other compute
      resources, as well as any efforts for or expectations of future
      funding</li>

    <li>results, publications, degrees, or presentations that will be
      produced using the allocation</li>

    <li>whether the project is expected to continue beyond this
      (one-year) allocation</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Joining an existing allocation</h2>

<p>If you are working on a project that already has an allocation, ask
  the principal investigator (PI) of the project or allocation to
  contact <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>. The
  request should include

  <ul>
    <li>the allocation account ID (usually starting
      with <code>UCB</code>)</li>

    <li>the name and username of the person to be added to the
      allocation</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Submitting a job to use an allocation</h2>

<p>Jobs submitted to the Research Computing queueing system will
  automatically use your default allocation. You can explicitely
  specify a different allocation using the <code>--account</code>
  (or <code>-A</code>) argument.</p>

<pre><code>$ sbatch --account UCB7111101 job-script.sh</code></pre>

<p>The allocation can be encoded in the job script itself
  using an <code>#SBATCH</code> directive.</p>

<pre><code>#SBATCH --account UCB7111101</code></pre>

<h2>Default allocation</h2>

<p>Users with multiple allocations can see their default allocation
using the <code>sacctmgr</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ sacctmgr show user $USER --parsable
User|Def Acct|Admin|
ralphie|ucb00000055|None|</code></pre>

<p>To change your default allocation,
  contact <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>

<h2>Checking your allocation</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm_ug_2012/SUG2012-TCHPC-sbank.pdf"><code>sbank</code></a>
  command allows you to check the balance of all allocations that you
  have access to.</p>

<pre><code>$ sbank balance statement -U $USER
User           Usage |        Account     Usage | Account Limit Available (CPU hrs)
---------- --------- + -------------- --------- + ------------- ---------
ralphie           48 | S00000005          4,352 | 1,666,667     1,662,314
ralphie            1 | UCB000000122      88,667 | 610,351         521,684</code></pre>
