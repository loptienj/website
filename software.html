<p>Research Computing manages a set of supported software for use on
  RC systems. This software is published using
  an <a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net">Environment Modules</a>
  system.</p>

<p>Users are encouraged to build custom software in
  a <a href="storage.html#projects">project directory</a>. Users may
  even maintain and publish local module files to dynamically configure
  a running environment to use the software. If this module is useful
  for the general user community, it may be adopted as a
  centrally-supported module.</p>

<p>We are happy to help with the installation of custom or third-party
  software. If you need assistance, please contact us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>
