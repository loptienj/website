<h1>Remote access and logging in</h1>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is available over the campus
network and the general Internet largely by way of the Secure Shell,
or ssh, protocol. Access is provided via one of the dedicated login
nodes.</p>

<h2>One-time passwords (OTP)</h2>

<p>One-Time Passwords (OTP) provide better security for online account
access than traditional memorized or stored passwords. The password
generated in the OTP login process is only valid for one session. A
string of six digits, generated approximately every 30 seconds, is
displayed to the customer on a hardware authenticator device. To log
in, the user enters their username and generates a password by
combining a secret four digit PIN with the six digit string displayed
on the authenticator, resulting in a 10-digit numeric password.</p>

<p>The standard authenticator (password generator) used by CU-Boulder
is the <a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/single_button_digipass/digipass_go6.aspx">VASCO GO-6</a>. Other authenticators are available including
<a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/software_digipass/digipass_for_mobile.aspx">smartphone
application based authenticators</a> and audio authenticators for the
visually impaired.</p>

<h2>NCAR accounts</h2>

<p>NCAR users can access RC resources using their NCAR account. Use
your NCAR Yubikey or CryptoCard to authenticate.</p>

<p>More information is available on
the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu">Computational & Information
Systems Lab</a> website.</p>

<h2>The secure shell (ssh)</h2>

<p>Once you have

  <ul>
    <li>obtained a Research Computing account;</li>
    <li>obtained an OTP authenticator;</li>
    <li>and registered and tested your OTP authenticator</li>
  </ul>

  you should be able to log into an RC login node using the secure
  shell (ssh).</p>

<p>The <code>ssh</code> command can be run from the Linux and OS X
command-line. For Windows clients we recommend
the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
application.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l $rc_username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>the first time you log in, the system will configure your internal
ssh key pair, used for authentication between internal hosts.</p>

<h3>Further reading</h3>

<p>The ssh protocol and its related applications have many
features. It can be used as simply as described here, to provide
  simple shell access to the RC login nodes; but it can also

  <ul>
    <li>transfer files,</li>
    <li>forward X11 GUI application interfaces,</li>
    <li>proxy TCP connections,</li>
    <li>multiplex sessions through a single connection,<li>
  </ul>

  and much more.</p>
