<h1>Remote access and logging in</h1>

<p>Access to Research Computing resources is available over the campus
  network and the general Internet largely by way of the Secure Shell,
  or ssh, protocol. Access is provided via one of the dedicated login
  nodes.</p>

<p>When you have logged into an RC login node, you are accessing one
  of several virtual machines intended to present a development
  environment, facilitate the submission of jobs to other resources,
  and enable interactive access to storage resources. Use of the login
  nodes should be restricted to editing, small-scale (non-MPI)
  compilation and job submission. Running CPU- or memory-intensive
  processes on the logni nodes is actively discoutaged. Data analysis
  and large-scale data transfers should be done via scheduled
  jobs. <a href="software-compilation.html">Software compilation</a>
  is best done on the targeted resource via
  an <a href="batch-queueing.html#interactive_jobs">interactive
    job</a> or (for applications that are meant to run on Janus) on one
  of the <a href="software-compilation.html#janus_compile_nodes">Janus
    compile nodes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="otp">One-time passwords (OTP)</h2>

<p>One-Time Passwords (OTP) provide better security for online account
  access than traditional memorized or stored passwords. The password
  generated in the OTP login process is only valid for one session. A
  string of six digits, generated approximately every 30 seconds, is
  displayed to the customer on a hardware authenticator device. To log
  in, the user enters their username and generates a password by
  combining a secret four digit PIN with the six digit string
  displayed on the authenticator, resulting in a 10-digit numeric
  password.</p>

<p>The standard authenticator (password generator) used by CU-Boulder
  is
  the <a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/single_button_digipass/digipass_go6.aspx">VASCO
    GO-6</a>. Other authenticators are available including
  <a href="https://www.vasco.com/products/client_products/software_digipass/digipass_for_mobile.aspx">smartphone
    application based authenticators</a> and audio authenticators for
  the visually impaired.</p>

<h3>Obtaining an OTP authenticator</h3>

<p>OTP authenticators are available at
  the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/support-training/it-service-center">IT
    Service Center</a> in
  the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/map.html?bldg=TCOM">Technology
    Learning Center</a>. You
  can <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/one-time-password-authentication/help/order-authenticator">order
    an authenticator online</a>, but you will need to retrieve it in
  person when it is ready. You will be asked to show ID to be given an
  authenticator.</p>

<p>OTP authenticators are also available at the Research Computing
  office in
  the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/map.html?bldg=ARCE">Administrative
    and Research Center</a>. Request an appointment by sending email
  to <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>. Again,
  you will be asked to show ID to be given an authenticator.</p>

<p>Authenticators are also available on the Auraria and Anshutz
  campuses.</p>

<p>If you cannot visit any of the above locations in
  person, <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/support-training/it-service-center">contact
    the IT Service Center</a> or email us
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a> to
  arrange an alternative.</p>

<h3>Registering an OTP authenticator</h3>

<p>An OTP authenticator must be registered with your account before it
  can be used. To register your device, visit
  the <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu">OTP Self Service</a> page,
  and follow the instructions
  under <a href="https://otp.colorado.edu/index.php?view=register">Register
    Your Device</a> to register your authenticator using
  your <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/identity-access-management/identikey">CU-Boulder
    IdentiKey</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting help</h3>

<p>If your authenticator is lost or damaged, or if you experience any
  other technical problems, please contact us right away
  at <a href="mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu">rc-help@colorado.edu</a>.</p>

<h2>NCAR accounts</h2>

<p>NCAR users can access RC resources using their NCAR account. Use
  your NCAR Yubikey or CryptoCard to authenticate.</p>

<p>More information is available on
  the <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu">Computational &amp;
  Information Systems Lab</a> website.</p>

<h2>The secure shell (ssh)</h2>

<p>Once you have</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtained a Research Computing account;</li>
  <li>obtained an OTP authenticator;</li>
  <li>and registered and tested your OTP authenticator</li>
</ul>

<p>you should be able to log into an RC login node using the secure
  shell (ssh).</p>

<p>The <code>ssh</code> command can be run from the Linux and OS X
  command-line. For Windows clients we recommend
  the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
  application.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -l $rc_username login.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<p>the first time you log in, the system will configure your internal
  ssh key pair, used for authentication between internal hosts.</p>

<pre><code>Attempting to create internal ssh config for connecting to
CURC managed resources...  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in /home/example/.ssh/curc.
Your public key has been saved in /home/example/.ssh/curc.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ed:43:02:88:99:10:d5:87:ed:84:51:b1:69:73:24:b4
example@login01.rc.colorado.edu</code></pre>

<h3>Further reading</h3>

<p>The ssh protocol and its related applications have many
  features. It can be used as simply as described here, to provide
  simple shell access to the RC login nodes; but it can also</p>

<ul>
  <li>transfer files,</li>
  <li>forward X11 GUI application interfaces,</li>
  <li>proxy TCP connections,</li>
  <li>multiplex sessions through a single connection,</li>
</ul>

<p>and much more.</p>
