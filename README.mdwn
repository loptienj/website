## Style guide

* Each major topic (as defined by a top-level entry in the outline)
  should be a single HTML page.

* Each topic page should include an introductory or summary section
  before any subheddings.

* All detail (non-introductory) information on a page should be headed
  by an &lt;h2&gt; element.

* Example commands meant to be entered on the command line should be
  prepended with the prompt '$ '.

* Anything meant to be typed directly should be enclosed in a
  &lt;code&gt; element.

* Links / hrefs should be embedded in regular text whenever
  appropriate, rather than in a separate "see also" statement.
